<h3><a href="ATLAS_2019_I1724098/index.html" style="text-decoration:none;">Jet substructure at 13 TeV (ATLAS_2019_I1724098)</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://inspire-hep.net/record/1724098">Inspire</a> &#124; <a href="http://hepdata.net/record/ins1724098">HepData</a> &#124; JHEP 1908 (2019) 033 &#124; doi:10.1007/JHEP08(2019)033 &#124; arXiv:1903.02942 [hep-ex]</p>
<p style="font-size:smaller;">A measurement of jet substructure observables is presented using data collected in 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC with proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. Large-radius jets groomed with the trimming and soft-drop algorithms are studied. Dedicated event selections are used to study jets produced by light quarks or gluons, and hadronically decaying top quarks and W bosons. The observables measured are sensitive to substructure, and therefore are typically used for tagging large-radius jets from boosted massive particles. These include the energy correlation functions and the $N$-subjettiness variables. The number of subjets and the Les Houches angularity are also considered. The distributions of the substructure variables, corrected for detector effects, are compared to the predictions of various Monte Carlo event generators. They are also compared between the large-radius jets originating from light quarks or gluons, and hadronically decaying top quarks and $W$ bosons.</p>

<p><a href="http://inspire-hep.net/record/1711114">Inspire</a> &#124; <a href="http://hepdata.net/record/ins1711114">HepData</a> &#124; Phys.Rev. D99 (2019) no.5, 052004 &#124; doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.99.052004 &#124; arXiv:1812.09283 [hep-ex]</p>
<p style="font-size:smaller;">The fragmentation of high-energy gluons at small opening angles is largely unconstrained by present measurements. Gluon splitting to $b$-quark pairs is a unique probe into the properties of gluon fragmentation because identified $b$-tagged jets provide a proxy for the quark daughters of the initial gluon. In this study, key differential distributions related to the $g\to b\bar{b}$ process are measured using 33fb$^{-1}$ of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV $pp$ collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2016. Jets constructed from charged-particle tracks, clustered with the anti-$k_\text{t}$ jet algorithm with radius parameter $R=0.2$, are used to probe angular scales below the $R=0.4$ jet radius. The observables are unfolded to particle level in order to facilitate direct comparisons with predictions from present and future simulations. Multiple significant differences are observed between the data and parton shower Monte Carlo predictions, providing input to improve these predictions of the main source of background events in analyses involving boosted Higgs bosons decaying into $b$-quarks.</p>

<h3><a href="SoftDropMass/index.html" style="text-decoration:none;">&lt;Insert short SoftDropMass description&gt; (SoftDropMass)</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p style="font-size:smaller;">&lt;A fairly long description, including what is measured and if possible what it is useful for in terms of MC validation and tuning. Use LaTeX for maths like $p_\perp &gt; 50\;\text{GeV}$.&gt;</p>
